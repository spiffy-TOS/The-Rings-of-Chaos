**The Rings of Chaos – Prime Forgians Lore**

---

### 🧘 Who Are the Prime Forgians?

The Prime Forgians are one of the three native species of Cinderverge. They appear to outsiders as stoic, monk-like sages, but in truth, they’re absurdly advanced in both technology and cosmic knowledge. Their true genius is hidden beneath layers of ceremony, ritual, and board game obsession.

They were entrusted with guarding the Prime Rings billions of years ago, and they encoded all their sacred knowledge, weapon blueprints, and Ring protocols into intricate, nonsensical board games. Only trained Forgians can understand the rules—everyone else just thinks they’re weird and obsessed with losing.

### 🌀 The Jibjab Doctrine

A famous turning point in Forgian history came when High Monk Jibjab prevented the destruction of the Prime Rings by suggesting:

> “What if they’re, like… important later?”

This quote became sacred canon.
The Rings were instead launched into space, sealed in a vault made of question marks, accompanied by a chant that rhymed with “banana.”

This idiocy is now considered divinely inspired wisdom, and entire monastic orders have sprung up around interpreting what Jibjab *meant*. (He was reportedly drunk on warp nectar at the time.)

### 🎲 Forgian Board Games

* **Every major secret** the monks possess is stored in a game box
* Winning a game grants memory access or reveals ancient tech
* Losing a game causes memory loss, spatial instability, or tentacle growth
* The most feared board game is *Monopoly*, which has only ever had one known survivor

### 🧙 Notable Forgians

* **High Monk Jibjab** – Responsible for the banana-chant Ring launch protocol. Regarded as a prophet. Probably an idiot.
* **Decked Monk** – The elaborately dressed monk who finds Spike and Skitch post-tutorial. Delivers the Skymarch warning.
* **The Wandering Loser** – A monk who’s lost over 9,000 games in a row and is now considered a holy data cache of failures
