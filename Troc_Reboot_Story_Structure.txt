**The Rings of Chaos — Reboot Story Structure**

---

### 📖 Prologue: The Heist

Years ago, Spike and Skitch pulled off the greatest pirate heist in galactic history — stealing a **Prime Ring** from a fortified military installation. But during the escape, their crew was killed in a massive explosion. Only they survived.

They sold the Ring to a mysterious **Broker** and retired rich on Cinderverge.

Spike built a bar from the wreckage of their ship — *The Loose Screw*. Skitch opened a mechanic shop underneath. They drank. They forgot. Life was good.

Until the Broker returned. And this time… he brought all five Prime Rings.

* When Spike asks why they weren’t destroyed, the monk replies:

  > "Destroy them? Of course we *considered* it. But then High Monk Jibjab said, and I quote, ‘What if they’re, like… important later?’ So we locked them in a vault made of question marks and launched them at the sky. Very official. There was a chant and everything. It rhymed with ‘banana.’"
* Spike: “What do you need with us then?”
* Skitch: “THE SKYMARCH HAS BEGUN! JOIN THE BLOODFEUD!”
* Monk: “Fucking what?”
* Spike: “Oh yeah, he’s right. Skymarch, Bloodfeud, the whole shebang. I already packed the ceremonial kazoo and three jars of war jelly. Let’s *freakin’ ride.*”
* Monk: “But you don’t even know what is needed from you. Are you dumb or are… you… dumb?”
* Spike: “Buddy, I’m *retired*. I don’t *need* to know. I just need something to punch, something to shoot, and someone weird to yell at. Congratulations—you just provided all three.”
* Skitch: “AND I BROUGHT THE BLOOD-PICKLES! THE SKY CRAVES BRINE!”
* **Main Quest Begins**: Find the next Prime Ring before the Broker does
