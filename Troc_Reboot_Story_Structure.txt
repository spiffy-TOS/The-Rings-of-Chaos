**The Rings of Chaos — Reboot Story Structure**

---

### 📖 Prologue: The Heist
Years ago, Spike and Skitch pulled off the greatest pirate heist in galactic history — stealing a **Prime Ring** from a fortified military installation. But during the escape, their crew was killed in a massive explosion. Only they survived.

They sold the Ring to a mysterious **Broker** and retired rich on Cinderverge.

Spike built a bar from the wreckage of their ship — *The Loose Screw*. Skitch opened a mechanic shop underneath. They drank. They forgot. Life was good.

Until the Broker returned. And this time… he brought all five Prime Rings.
