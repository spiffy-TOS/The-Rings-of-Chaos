# ⚔️ The Rings of Chaos — Combat System Overview

## 🔄 Chaos Meter System

Each character has their own **Chaos Meter** which fills up as they deal or receive damage during battle.

### 🧍 Spike
- **Combat Role:** Tech Gunslinger
- **Basic Attack:** Fires a custom-built blaster with unpredictable mod attachments.
- **Ultimate (Chaos Attack): "Paradox Sync"**
  - Activated when Spike's Chaos Meter is full.
  - Triggers a powerful, random effect drawn from an alternate timeline where things "went right".
  - May summon ghost pirates, glitch time, reverse damage, or create language fluency in ancient tongues.

#### 🔫 Weapon Behavior: Spike’s Gun
- **Non-Chaos Mode:** Unpredictable but reliable. Randomly cycles through:
  - Forcefield fists
  - Fireballs
  - Lightning bullets
  - Pack of dogs
  - Ghost warriors

- **Chaos Mode:** Wild and dramatic effects including:
  - Flaming middle finger blast
  - Stampede of flaming horses
  - Stomped by a giant flamingo foot

### 🐾 Skitch
- **Combat Role:** Mechanic Mayhem
- **Basic Attack:** Hurls an oversized wrench or explosive gadget.
- **Support Ability:** Deploys traps, disables enemy weapons, or triggers mechanical chaos (cooldown-based).
- **Ultimate (Chaos Attack): "Anvil Protocol"**
  - Skitch’s already comically large hammer **grows three sizes larger**.
  - He slams it down with devastating force, often accompanied by a nonsense battle cry like:
    > “GRANDMA’S KNUCKLE RECIPE!”
  - High damage, big AoE, massive camera shake.

### 🌪️ Shared Chaos Attack: "Combo Calamity"
- Requires **both Spike and Skitch** to have full Chaos Meters.
- Player receives prompt:
  > “The air ripples with chaotic synergy. UNLEASH COMBO CALAMITY?”
- A devastating cinematic attack combining their abilities:
  - Example: Spike opens a time rift; Skitch hurls a molten wrench into it — it reappears behind enemies with explosive impact.
