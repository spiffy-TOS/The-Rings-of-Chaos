**The Rings of Chaos — Combined Combat & World Lore (Reboot Edition)**

---

### 🔫 Spike’s Combat Style: Tech Gunslinger

Spike fights like a brilliant disaster held together with duct tape and rage. He uses:

* **Custom-built firearms** with unpredictable mod attachments
* **Experimental gadgets** that often explode *just barely* in his favor
* **Improvised pirate tech** from old war relics, bar gear, or stolen monk artifacts

He’s precise, creative, and a little too confident. Think: *Han Solo with a bugged skill tree.*

---

### 🌀 Latent Power: The Paradox Flask

During the heist escape, a shard of a Prime Ring embedded itself in Spike’s body — specifically inside his hip flask. Now known as the **Paradox Flask**, this cursed relic links Spike to alternate realities.

**Mechanic:**

* Once per battle, Spike can drink from the flask
* There’s a random chance it syncs him to a timeline where things *went right*
* The result? One wild, game-changing effect

**Examples of Flask Effects:**

* Swap positions with an enemy
* Summon ghost versions of fallen crew
* Gain +1000 luck for 10 seconds
* Weapon turns into a duck that shoots laser eggs
* Everyone suddenly speaks Prime Forgian for 30 seconds

**Note:** Every use includes Skitch yelling: “**DON’T DRINK THAT, YOU DUMBASS, IT’S STILL WARMING UP!**”

---

### 🤖 Skitch in Combat

* Skitch is your backup brawler and battlefield technician
* He wields junk-mod weapons and magnetized explosives
* Occasionally screams gibberish that grants buffs if you interpret it right
* Unlockable ability: *Mechanic’s Meltdown* — causes every device on the battlefield to activate at once, including enemy weapons

---

### 🔨 Hammy the Hammer (Skitch’s Weapon)

Skitch wields a spiked mallet named **Hammy the Hammer**, which is larger than he is.

**Base Power: Mega Ham**

* Deals damage equivalent to being hit by **500 fully grown male pigs**
* First upgrade boosts this to **1,000 pigs**
* Max upgrade delivers **5,000 pigs** worth of force

**Augments (Unlockable Later in Game):**

* Acid
* Fire
* Ice
* **Chaos** (Hidden augment found only through a brutally difficult side quest)

Despite its absurdity, Hammy is extremely effective. Skitch swings it with shocking strength and precision. Enemies rarely see it coming — or survive it when they do.

---

### ⚔️ Enemies & Combat Design Goals

* Combat should feel **chaotic but controllable**
* Enemies are often **quirky** (think: monks who weaponize board games, drunken mech-suit bounty hunters)
* Boss fights will often **change rules mid-fight** (e.g., entering Round 2 of a fight causes the entire UI to glitch)
* Strategy comes from understanding your tools — not rigid builds

---

### 🧪 Potential Additions (Future Consideration)

* Unlockable gadgets through bar quests
* Moddable guns with “stupid-smart” upgrades (e.g., bullet ricochet that becomes homing when you miss badly)
* Board game mechanics applied to mid-battle choices (roll to dodge? bluff to confuse?)

### 🌍 Planet: Cinderverge

A lush paradise world divided into five massive, ring-shaped continents. Cinderverge was designed to protect — or imprison — the five **Prime Rings**, ancient relics of cosmic power scattered billions of years ago.

The planet’s surface is peaceful and harmonious... until the Broker returns with all five Rings, destabilizing everything.

---

### 💍 The Prime Rings

Once scattered across the galaxy, the five Prime Rings have returned to Cinderverge. Each holds ancient power capable of shaping reality. Their activation is believed to awaken **Korangar**, the planet-dwelling god-monster.

The monks of Cinderverge were entrusted with the knowledge of what to do should the Rings return — but after three billion years, their purpose is fractured and fogged by doubt, ritual, and reinterpretation.

---

### 🧬 The Species of Cinderverge

#### 🧘‍♂️ Prime Forgians

Ancient monk-like beings who appear pious and serene, but are actually hyper-intelligent and technologically adept.

* Keepers of sacred knowledge stored in elaborate, coded **board games**
* Losing a game causes memory loss; winning unlocks hidden truths
* Their ultimate trial: the legendary board game **Monopoly**, from which only one player may emerge sane

#### 🪳 Therbrgzgzzgrrrr (pronounced exactly like it’s spelled)

Chaotic insectoid nomads with miraculous survival instincts. Dumb, loud, and always arguing — but somehow, they thrive.

* Live in loud caravans, constantly scavenging and repairing with snacks and duct tape
* Culture of accidental competence and superstition
* Heroes are chosen based on who *almost died the funniest*
* Provide unintentional comic relief and unpredictable solutions

#### 🪨 Stobbon

Stone-bodied tribal natives covered in glowing rune-like tattoos earned throughout their lives.

* Deeply spiritual, rooted in ancient mysticism
* Cultural superstition: **they only move when unobserved**
* Believed to contain memories of the planet itself
* Strong, durable, and prone to long dramatic pauses

---

### 🧭 World Design Themes

* Ancient cosmic mystery collides with chaotic irreverence
* Even paradise has layers of myth-tech and forgotten purpose
* History isn’t passed down — it’s unlocked, twisted, and shouted through a bar fight

---

### 🌌 Lore Hook

What happens when relics of absolute power fall into the hands of pirates, monks, trashbugs, and rock-people with trust issues?

You get The Rings of Chaos.

---

*Spike’s not the strongest or the fastest. He just fights like the universe owes him money.*
