## 🎮 What is *The Rings of Chaos*?

*The Rings of Chaos* is a cinematic, lore-rich, emotionally layered RPG set on **Ferragos** — a once fractured world now united against a cosmic threat. Built in Python as a passion project, the game blends:

- 💫 Character-driven story arcs
- 🧠 Emotional worldbuilding
- ⚔️ Unique class-based combat
- 🛸 Ancient tech, alien invaders, and poetic chaos

## 🧠 World Snapshot

- **World**: Ferragos — a massive oceanic planet with floating island rings and planetary harmony... until something woke up.
- **Tone**: Bittersweet myth, black comedy, and cosmic horror — with a hint of hope.
- **Main Character**: You play as **Trax**, a reborn warrior deployed by the planet itself.
- **Magic System**: The **Corelink** — a class-activated, tech-based conduit for wielding magic and weapon techniques.

## 🧙‍♂️ Playable Classes

Each class reflects a different playstyle and personality:

- ⚔️ **Ruinblade** — The tank. Battle-born and brutally practical.
- 🗡️ **Rift Walker** — The rogue. Master of distortion and deception.
- 🎶 **Tune Priest** — The wizard. Harmonic chaos channeler.
- 🐲 **Gremlin Summoner** — The summoner. Commands beasts, weather, and problems.
- ☠️ **Bone Wizard of Party Resurrection** — The necromancer. Undead, unhinged, and unnervingly helpful.

## 🌌 The Threat

Ferragos is peaceful now — almost too peaceful. The enemy isn’t from within…  
It’s from *above*.

An alien force has arrived to awaken something massive and ancient buried deep in the planet’s core — something the united cultures of Ferragos sealed away eons ago.
