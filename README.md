# 🌌 The Rings of Chaos

**The Rings of Chaos** is a high-res 8-bit sci-fi RPG about retired space pirates, ancient chaos relics, and the end of paradise. Set on the lush and mysterious planet **Cinderverge**, you play as **Spike**, a brilliant-but-broken ex-pirate bar owner whose past comes roaring back when the Broker returns — wielding the power of all five **Prime Rings**.

### 🧨 Pitch
After the greatest heist in galactic history, Spike and his chaotic crew retired to the peaceful world of Cinderverge. They thought it was over.  
Seven years later, the man who bought their stolen Ring is back — and he's found the other four.

Now paradise is unraveling, the Rings are waking something ancient, and your old crew is dead.

You and your mechanic Skitch are all that’s left. Time to gear up, drink deep, and raise hell.

## 🌍 World Overview: Cinderverge

A paradise world engineered to protect (or imprison) the **Prime Rings** — five god-tier relics scattered across space billions of years ago.

Cinderverge is divided into **five massive ring-shaped continents**, each with unique biomes, cultures, and secrets. Its surface has been peaceful for eons… until now.

- 🧱 **The Prime Forgians** – techno-monk keepers of ancient Ring knowledge, storing it in absurdly complex board games  
- 🪨 **The Stobbon** – stone-bodied mystics who only move when unobserved, bound by ancestral traditions  
- 🤪 **The Therbrgzgzzgrrrr** – chaotic shapeshifters who communicate through smell and scream-laughter

## 🔫 Main Character: Spike

A **tech gunslinger** and former pirate captain, Spike fights with:

- Custom-built firearms and experimental mods  
- Pirate gadgets and repurposed bar tech  
- Improvised tools that *probably* won't explode

### 🌀 Latent Power: The Paradox Flask

A quantum-entangled liquor flask embedded with a shard of a Prime Ring. When Spike drinks from it in combat, there's a random chance it syncs with a timeline where things went *horribly right*.

The effects are dramatic, unpredictable, and always game-changing.  
Skitch hates it. Spike loves it. The universe isn’t sure.
