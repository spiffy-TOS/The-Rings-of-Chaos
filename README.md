# 🌀 The Rings of Chaos – README

## A Rough Introduction, As Scribbled by Skitch (translated by Trax)

Okay so listen — this isn't, like, an official guide or anything. It's just a bunch of notes I (Skitch) left lying around because people kept asking what this world *is*. And then Trax found them and cleaned up the spelling and probably removed all the jokes about soup. You're welcome. Or not. Whatever.

Anyway.

Ferragos is weird. It’s a giant ocean planet with ring-shaped continents and buried ██████ that nobody really understands. It’s a giant ocean planet with ring-shaped continents and buried stuff nobody really understands. The land itself was built forever ago — like, really built — on purpose. We just don’t know what that purpose *was*. People here fight about it. A lot.

There’s magic, yeah. Sort of. It’s more like... music? Resonance? Feelings that punch you in the chest and make machines blink? I don’t know, I’m not a wizard. Ask Vexra. Actually don’t. She bit someone last time.

Trax (the guy translating this) is apparently important. He used to be ██████████████████. Now he’s something *more*. Or *less*. Depends who you ask. is apparently important.  

I mostly just fix things and try not to explode.

## 🌍 What You’re Walking Into

- Ferragos is big. Like... way too big.
- Everything’s old, broken, or lying about what it really is.
- Factions run the show, but none of them agree on what the show *is*.
- Magic is tied to memory and emotion. Don’t bottle things up or you might literally combust.
- If something’s humming, glowing, or vibrating — ██████████████████████████████████████████. — don’t lick it. Unless it asks nicely.

## 🎮 Stuff You Can Probably Expect

- Talking to people who don’t want to be understood.
- Making choices that matter more later than now.
- Fixing ██████████████████████████████.
- Feeling things, probably against your will.
- A quest board. Eventually. We’re working on it.

## 🛠 What’s Actually Playable Right Now

Nothing. Still worldbuilding with light coding. More to come.

## ❓ Why This README Exists

So people stop asking what the game is and I can go back to rewiring melted panels.

Also, because Trax said it might help someone “███████████████████████████████████████.” Which is just fancy talk for: *stuff's broken, and you’re part of the fixing.*

Good luck. Or don’t. Again — whatever.
