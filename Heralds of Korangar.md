## The Heralds of Korangar

The six Heralds of Korangar are powerful, chaotic entities that emerged when the Broker placed the third Prime Ring on Cinderverge. Each one manifests in a different part of the world, spreading madness and corruption. The player encounters the first Herald in the vertical slice, with the others encountered later in the full game.

## Post-Tutorial Scene

After the battle with the Inflatable Cultist, the game cuts to **Spike and Skitch back at The Loose Screw**, their bar on the bottom ring of Cinderverge. A **Prime Forgian monk** enters — visually distinct and more elaborately adorned than any other monk the player has seen.

This monk delivers the **first major exposition dump**, providing information on:

* The Prime Rings
* The Broker’s actions
* The arrival of the Heralds of Korangar

This sets up the next phase of the story and opens up exploration of the bottom ring.
