## The Rings of Chaos – Lore & Worldbuilding

### 🌍 Cinderverge – Planet Overview

* Paradise world made of five massive ring continents
* Originally designed to protect—or imprison—the five Prime Rings
* Home to three species:

  * Prime Forgians: Ancient, monk-like, technologically adept
  * Stobbon: Stone-bodied mystics, only move when unobserved
  * Therbrgzgzzgrrrr: Chaotic lifeforms not yet fully documented

### 🧙 The Prime Forgians

* Lifespan: 3 billion years
* Entrusted with safeguarding knowledge of the Prime Rings
* Store information via sacred, absurd board games

  * Losing a game = memory loss
  * Winning = unlocks ancient truths
* Some orders have forgotten or twisted their original purpose

### 🎲 Sacred Board Game Lore

* Knowledge of the Rings is hidden inside these games
* First encountered game: **R.I.S.K. (Roll Initiative, Scream Kinetically)**

  * Player is shrunk and battles in the game board’s center
  * Victories unlock clues about the Prime Rings
* Ultimate board game: **Monopologamy: Eternal Debt Edition**

  * One known survivor
  * Holds the final truth of the Rings

### 🧎 Monk Introduction Scene (Canon)

* Monk enters The Loose Screw after Inflatable Cultist fight

* Decked-out appearance, visually distinct from other monks

* Delivers this line on why Rings weren’t destroyed:

  > "Destroy them? Of course we *considered* it. But then High Monk Jibjab said, and I quote, ‘What if they’re, like… important later?’ So we locked them in a vault made of question marks and launched them at the sky. Very official. There was a chant and everything. It rhymed with ‘banana.’"

* When Spike asks what they need from him:

  * Skitch screams nonsense about the skymarch and war jelly
  * Monk replies: “Fucking what?”
  * Spike responds: “I don’t *need* to know. I just need something to punch, something to shoot, and someone weird to yell at. Congratulations—you just provided all three.”

### 📜 Lore Justification: Broken Achievements

* Side effect of the Rings’ return
* Time and logic have begun to unravel at micro levels
* Achievements appear randomly, sometimes prophetically

  * Some monks believe these are messages from divergent timelines

### 🛒 Barkley the Merchant (Canon Lore NPC)

* Busted vending machine operator on the bottom ring
* Refuses to sell unless amused
* Lore implication: Barkley may have once been a Prime Ring cultist who lost his faith… and his filter
* Now speaks only in bitter sarcasm and vending codes
