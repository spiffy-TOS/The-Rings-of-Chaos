**The Rings of Chaos — NPCs & Questlines (Reboot Edition)**

---

### 🏠 Central Hub: The Loose Screw
Former pirate ship turned dive bar, now the emotional and narrative center of the game. Spike runs the upper level. Skitch operates his chaotic garage down below. Everything important starts (or ends) here.

The Loose Screw is filled with drinkers, schemers, ex-mercs, forgotten monks, and glitchy informants — some regulars, some surprises.

### 🍻 Bar Regulars (Core NPCs)

#### 🦀 Uncle Drizz
- Species: Crab-person
- Role: Wisdom-drenched barstool fixer, ex-bounty hunter

#### 🎰 Jexa Korr
- Species: Cyborg
- Role: Gambler with a slot machine arm
- Quirk: Speaks entirely in wagers, odds, and metaphors

### ❓ Quest Delivery System
**Quests are given via:**
- **Weirdos at the bar**
- **Drinks on the wall** (specials that come with rumors)
- **Skitch’s garage bulletin board**
- **Ancient monk board games** (literally—complete a game, get a quest)

- Trying to pet Skitch during a boss fight

---

### 🧠 NPC Philosophy
All NPCs serve **gameplay**, **story**, or **utter nonsense** — preferably all three.
They’re designed to:
- Unlock side mechanics
- Drop quest clues and rewards
- Serve as emotional, comedic, or lore anchors

*“Everyone at The Loose Screw is a little broken. That’s why it works.”*
