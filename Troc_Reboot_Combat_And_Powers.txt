**The Rings of Chaos — Combat & Powers (Reboot Edition)**

---

### 🔫 Spike’s Combat Style: Tech Gunslinger

Spike fights like a brilliant disaster held together with duct tape and rage. He uses:

* **Custom-built firearms** with unpredictable mod attachments
* **Experimental gadgets** that often explode *just barely* in his favor
* **Improvised pirate tech** from old war relics, bar gear, or stolen monk artifacts

He’s precise, creative, and a little too confident. Think: *Han Solo with a bugged skill tree.*

### 🌀 Latent Power: The Paradox Flask

During the heist escape, a shard of a Prime Ring embedded itself in Spike’s body — specifically inside his hip flask. Now known as the **Paradox Flask**, this cursed relic links Spike to alternate realities.

**Mechanic:**

* Once per battle, Spike can drink from the flask
* There’s a random chance it syncs him to a timeline where things *went right*
* The result? One wild, game-changing effect

**Examples of Flask Effects:**

* Swap positions with an enemy
* Summon ghost versions of fallen crew
* Gain +1000 luck for 10 seconds
* Weapon turns into a duck that shoots laser eggs
* Everyone suddenly speaks Prime Forgian for 30 seconds

**Note:** Every use includes Skitch yelling: “**DON’T DRINK THAT, YOU DUMBASS, IT’S STILL WARMING UP!**”

### 🤖 Skitch in Combat

* Skitch is your backup brawler and battlefield technician
* He wields junk-mod weapons and magnetized explosives
* Occasionally screams gibberish that grants buffs if you interpret it right
* Unlockable ability: *Mechanic’s Meltdown* — causes every device on the battlefield to activate at once, including enemy weapons

---

### 🔨 Hammy the Hammer (Skitch’s Weapon)

Skitch wields a spiked mallet named **Hammy the Hammer**, which is larger than he is.

**Base Power: Mega Ham**

* Deals damage equivalent to being hit by **500 fully grown male pigs**
* First upgrade boosts this to **1,000 pigs**
* Max upgrade delivers **5,000 pigs** worth of force

**Augments (Unlockable Later in Game):**

* Acid
* Fire
* Ice
* **Chaos** (Hidden augment found only through a brutally difficult side quest)

Despite its absurdity, Hammy is extremely effective. Skitch swings it with shocking strength and precision. Enemies rarely see it coming — or survive it when they do.

---

### ⚔️ Enemies & Combat Design Goals

* Combat should feel **chaotic but controllable**
* Enemies are often **quirky** (think: monks who weaponize board games, drunken mech-suit bounty hunters)
* Boss fights will often **change rules mid-fight** (e.g., entering Round 2 of a fight causes the entire UI to glitch)
* Strategy comes from understanding your tools — not rigid builds

---

### 🧪 Potential Additions (Future Consideration)

* Unlockable gadgets through bar quests
* Moddable guns with “stupid-smart” upgrades (e.g., bullet ricochet that becomes homing when you miss badly)
* Board game mechanics applied to mid-battle choices (roll to dodge? bluff to confuse?)

---

*Spike’s not the strongest or the fastest. He just fights like the universe owes him money.*
