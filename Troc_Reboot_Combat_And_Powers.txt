**The Rings of Chaos — World Lore (Reboot Edition)**

---

### 🌍 Planet: Cinderverge

A lush paradise world divided into five massive, ring-shaped continents. Cinderverge was designed to protect — or imprison — the five **Prime Rings**, ancient relics of cosmic power scattered billions of years ago.

The planet’s surface is peaceful and harmonious... until the Broker returns with all five Rings, destabilizing everything.

### 💍 The Prime Rings

Once scattered across the galaxy, the five Prime Rings have returned to Cinderverge. Each holds ancient power capable of shaping reality. Their activation is believed to awaken **Korangar**, the planet-dwelling god-monster.

The monks of Cinderverge were entrusted with the knowledge of what to do should the Rings return — but after three billion years, their purpose is fractured and fogged by doubt, ritual, and reinterpretation.

### 🧬 The Species of Cinderverge

#### 🧘‍♂️ Prime Forgians

Ancient monk-like beings who appear pious and serene, but are actually hyper-intelligent and technologically adept.

* Keepers of sacred knowledge stored in elaborate, coded **board games**
* Losing a game causes memory loss; winning unlocks hidden truths
* Their ultimate trial: the legendary board game **Monopoly**, from which only one player may emerge sane

#### 🪳 Therbrgzgzzgrrrr (pronounced exactly like it’s spelled)

Chaotic insectoid nomads with miraculous survival instincts. Dumb, loud, and always arguing — but somehow, they thrive.

* Live in loud caravans, constantly scavenging and repairing with snacks and duct tape
* Culture of accidental competence and superstition
* Heroes are chosen based on who *almost died the funniest*
* Provide unintentional comic relief and unpredictable solutions

#### 🪨 Stobbon

Stone-bodied tribal natives covered in glowing rune-like tattoos earned throughout their lives.

* Deeply spiritual, rooted in ancient mysticism
* Cultural superstition: **they only move when unobserved**
* Believed to contain memories of the planet itself
* Strong, durable, and prone to long dramatic pauses

### 🧭 World Design Themes

* Ancient cosmic mystery collides with chaotic irreverence
* Even paradise has layers of myth-tech and forgotten purpose
* History isn’t passed down — it’s unlocked, twisted, and shouted through a bar fight
