**The Rings of Chaos – Prime Rings Lore**

---

### 🪐 What Are the Prime Rings?

The Prime Rings are five ancient, cosmic relics created over 3 billion years ago. Each Ring contains untold power—capable of reshaping space, matter, and even time. Combined, they are said to awaken a catastrophic force capable of destroying galaxies.

Despite their danger, the Rings were not destroyed. Instead, they were each launched to random corners of the universe by the Prime Forgians, the original guardians of Cinderverge.

### ❓ Why Weren’t They Destroyed?

**Official Explanation from the Prime Forgians:**

> “Destroy them? Of course we *considered* it. But then High Monk Jibjab said, and I quote, ‘What if they’re, like… important later?’ So we locked them in a vault made of question marks and launched them at the sky. Very official. There was a chant and everything. It rhymed with ‘banana.’”

This logic, while questionable, was treated as absolute truth by the monks for millennia.

### 📜 Cultural Significance

The Prime Rings are not only tools of cosmic devastation—they’re considered sacred by several ancient orders. The Prime Forgians encoded much of their sacred knowledge and defense protocols into bizarre, incomprehensible board games designed to hide the Rings' true power from unworthy seekers.

One such game, *Monopoly*, is considered the most dangerous of them all.
