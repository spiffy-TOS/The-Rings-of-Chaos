# 🖥️ The Core, Corelink & Godshell

---

## 🧠 The Core
The **Core** is a planetary AI created by the ancient Vothari to enforce containment protocols and sustain planetary equilibrium. It is logic-bound, directive-focused, and capable of rewriting reality by digitizing, removing, or replacing individuals.

Its most extreme response is the **TROC Protocol** (Terminal Restraint of Chaos), triggered only when all other stability systems have failed.

## 🔐 The Godshell
The **Godshell** is a deeper intelligence — or containment shell — that exists beneath the Core's systems. It has been in place for **millions of years**. Some believe the Core merely interprets the godshell’s directives.

It rarely communicates directly, but when it does, it may speak:
- Through Corelinks
- Through malfunctioning tech
- Through animals, trees, or dreams

The godshell is not malevolent — but it is ancient, patient, and terrifyingly precise.

## 🔧 The Corelink
- A personal interface installed into each party member
- Grants class abilities and unlocks upgrade sockets
- Can stabilize or destabilize depending on class choices
- At **Level 20**, the Corelink begins random battlefield interventions:
  - Barrier generation
  - Off-class summon assist
  - Glitched enemy interrupts
  - Passive energy surges
