1. World Overview: Ferragos

Ferragos is a Jupiter-sized oceanic world with concentric island rings built by an ancient, likely post-singularity civilization. It's an engineered planet where each ring serves both as a cultural divide and mechanical barrier.

Planet composition: fully oceanic with floating/anchored landmasses

The rings represent environmental strata: Fire on top, Cold on bottom

Estimated construction: ~10,000 years ago

Core theory: the rings were built to contain, isolate, or protect what lies beneath the Harmonic Core

The deeper into Ferragos you go, the stranger things get. Reality bends. Time echoes. The Harmonic Core pulses louder.

2. Magic System: Harmonic Core

Magic on Ferragos isn't a force you cast — it's one you tune into. Harmonics function like emotional radio frequencies. Memory, resonance, and intention shape reality.

Everyone can access the Harmonic Core to a small degree

Thornari were once the most powerful harmonic users, now suppressed

Overuse leads to burnout — literal and psychological

Key mechanic: harmonic syncing with tools, objects, or ruins to unlock their secrets

Music and emotional states influence spellcasting, puzzle-solving, and even dialogue

Faction quests: alignment-based missions that affect regional trust

Recon / Sabotage: Forgebound vs Embercore tension

Environmental puzzles: tied to harmonic tuning and resonance states

Optional cult missions: may reveal unexpected truths or glitches

Upan Mischief Quests:

“The Hat That Wasn't Yours” – silly multi-stage trickster puzzle

“Gameglade Invasion” – prank-based defense mission

“The Trick That Shook the World” – godshell ritual game quest

“The Big Tag” – emotional legacy tag-run across Cinderverge

9. Minor Species & Wild Zones

🌈 The Upan

Type: Minor Species / Mischief FactionZone: Mid to Lower Rings (Forest Groves, Biocrystal Valleys, Overgrown Ruins)Affiliations: None (technically) – but have weird side-pacts with Thornari, Ringwalkers, and possibly the godshell itself.

🧬 Description

The Upan are small, fuzzy creatures who thrive on chaos, color, and play. Each Upan is about the size of a large rabbit, with brilliant multicolored fur and huge gleaming eyes. Their bodies pulse with faint bioluminescence when emotionally stimulated — which is always.

They do not age in any traditional sense. Instead, they “change color” during major life milestones, becoming a new shade when they earn a title or trick a notable traveler. Some Upan are ancient, wearing flower crowns and glowing softly with wisdom or weirdness.

🎭 Personality & Culture

Live communally in Gameglades, enchanted forest clearings warded by puzzles and pranks.

Communicate through game-songs, which serve as both history and social contract.

Believe that the universe itself is playing a game — and they want in on it.

Worship “The Big Trick,” an ancient Upan who supposedly stole a Corelink fragment from a godshell envoy by winning a riddle war.

“Nothing is true, everything is tag.”

🧩 Gameplay Functions

Gatekeepers of ancient ruins, forest dungeons, or forgotten biocrystal nodes.

Offer sidequests that are entirely mischief-based.

Can reward players with off-class Corelink mods, emotion-powered relics, or cryptic lore (usually hidden behind games).

Sometimes appear mid-battle to randomly “help” by tripping an enemy… or you.

⚠️ Narrative Role

May be messengers of the godshell in disguise — or just plugged into Cinderverge’s weirdness by existing.

Occasionally break the fourth wall or glitch the world momentarily.

When they really like you, they might call you "Big Tag."

🔥 Example NPC: Bloop the Blue

Color: Sky-blue with white swirl patterns

Known for: Starting a war between two frogs for fun

Quest: Hides your class gear and demands you play hide-and-seek to find it

Secret: Knows the true location of one of the lost Ringfragments — but will only give a clue if you lose to him three times in a row

“Want your hat back? Beat me in riddles, or I wear it forever. Even at weddings.”– Snikk the Red, Upan Duel Champion
