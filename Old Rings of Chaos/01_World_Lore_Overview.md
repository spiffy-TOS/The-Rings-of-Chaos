# üåç World & Lore Overview

**Cinderverge** is a ring-based, partially collapsed world watched over by an ancient planetary AI called the **Core**, itself a subordinate interface to the **godshell** ‚Äî a containment intelligence tasked with preventing the rise of a buried godkiller.

The **Core** can rewrite, relocate, or erase individuals to preserve planetary balance. It enforces stability through activation protocols, automated skyships, and ancient vault systems built by a long-dead precursor race (likely the Vothari).

The player character, **Trax**, is not born ‚Äî he is activated. A Corelink-compatible construct brought online by the Core under the **TROC Protocol** (Terminal Restraint of Chaos). His mission is unknown. His survival is not guaranteed.

The world is layered in mystery:
- **Floating city-rings**, **collapsed vault zones**, and **resonant scars** from earlier wars
- **Factions** that barely tolerate one another in the aftermath of collapse
- **Artifacts** that pulse with godshell energy, awakening memories and technologies older than language

Cinderverge isn‚Äôt just alive. It remembers.
