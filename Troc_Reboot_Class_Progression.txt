**The Rings of Chaos — Class Progression & Player Growth (Reboot Edition)**

---

### 🎯 No Classes. Only Chaos.
In the rebooted *Rings of Chaos*, you don’t select a class — you play as **Spike**, a legendary pirate turned tech gunslinger with a busted reality-bending flask in his coat pocket.

Rather than a traditional RPG class system, player progression is shaped by:
- **Tech Upgrades** (for Spike’s custom firearms and gadgets)
- **Flask Mutations** (new Paradox Flask effects unlocked over time)
- **Quest Outcomes** (which shift Spike’s passive bonuses and tactical options)
- **Companion Loadouts** (Skitch and others add new mechanics via synergy)

---

### 🔧 Upgrade Paths

#### 🔫 Gunslinger Mods
- **Sidearm Slot**: Core pistol, customizable with 3 mods
  - Mods: ricochet, phase ammo, shrapnel burst, “sticky argument” (bullets talk back)
- **Heavy Weapon Slot**: One experimental weapon at a time
  - Examples: beam shotgun, gravity launcher, magnetic trip mine glove

#### 🧪 Gadget Track
- Up to 3 equippable gadgets
  - Ex: portable portal puck, smoke puff 2.0 (actually flammable), arcwire grenade

#### 🍾 Flask Evolution
- The Paradox Flask gains “glitch nodes” the more you use it
  - Nodes unlock new chaos effects
  - Some permanently alter combat rules
  - Others rewrite dialogue or alter reality flavor

---

### 🚀 Progression Through Experience
- Instead of leveling, players gain **Upgrades** and **Unlocks** through:
  - Major quest completions
  - Board game victories
  - Solving paradoxes (intended or otherwise)
  - Using Skitch’s unstable forge (once repaired)

---

### 🧍 Companion Influence
Your companions add unique battle options:

#### Skitch (Always Equipped)
- Boosts gadget efficiency
- Occasionally repairs your gun *during combat*
- Will activate his “Mechanic Meltdown” on death or low HP

#### Others (TBD)
- Unlock companions through story events
- Bring one active per mission (others offer passive bonuses)
- Example: Grubslap may randomly generate loot… or throw it at enemies

---

### 📈 Replay Value
- Alternate flask builds unlock only in New Game+
- Multiple gadget trees = multiple playstyles
- Quest outcomes can influence unlock path (e.g., sabotaging a monk vault grants Flask upgrade instead of weapon mod)

---

*You don’t build a class. You build Spike into the version of himself that might survive this mess.*
