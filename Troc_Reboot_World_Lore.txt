**The Rings of Chaos (TROC) — Reboot Lore Overview**

---

### 🌍 Planet: Cinderverge
Cinderverge is a paradise world made up of five massive, ring-shaped continents. It was once home to peace, balance, and harmony among its three native species. But the recent return of the five legendary **Prime Rings** threatens to unravel everything.

Once long ago, the monks of Cinderverge were entrusted with the knowledge of what to do if the Rings ever came back. But that was 3 billion years ago. Now? They’ve forgotten. Some doubt. Some left. Some repurposed their entire orders. One species remembers more than they let on...

### ⚔️ Main Characters
**Spike** — Retired pirate captain and tech gunslinger. Athletic but portly. Charismatic, smart, a little messy, and deeply competent. He runs the bar **The Loose Screw**, which was built from the wreckage of his ship, the **Flaming Willow**.

**Skitch** — A five-foot-tall sentient red panda mechanic. His voice sounds like filthy, nonsensical gibberish due to a broken communicator. Everyone understands him anyway. Has a scarred eye, singed fur, and a garage under the bar. Comic genius with a deadly serious delivery.

---

### 🏠 The Loose Screw
The Loose Screw is the bar at the heart of the story — a former pirate ship-turned-tavern built from the ruins of the Flaming Willow. Spike runs the upper level as a bar, while Skitch operates a mechanic’s shop in the lower decks. It’s also where a lot of weirdos hang out...

---

### ☕ Notable Regulars
- **Uncle Drizz**: Elder crab-person, ex-bounty hunter, senile but sometimes lethal advice.
- **Jexa Korr**: Cyborg gambler with a slot machine for an arm. Talks in odds.
- **Grubslap**: Raccoon/ferret hybrid who thinks they own the bar. Always starting quests — some of them accidentally real.

---

### 🔓 The Heist
Spike and Skitch were part of a legendary pirate crew who stole one of the **Prime Rings** from a galactic military fortress. But during the escape, an explosion killed the rest of the crew. Only Spike and Skitch survived. They sold the Ring to a mysterious **Broker**, retired rich on Cinderverge... until the Broker came back.

This time? He’s got **all five Prime Rings**.

---

### 🌸 The Prime Forgians
One of the native species of Cinderverge. They appear to be traditional monks but are secretly brilliant technologists with ancient knowledge. They were entrusted with protecting the planet if the Rings returned.

They store all sacred knowledge in the form of **coded board games**. Lose one, you forget something. Win one, you unlock ancient secrets. Outsiders think it’s a hobby. They’re wrong. One such game is a cursed legend:

**Monopoly. Only one player ever survives.**

---

### 😈 The Broker & Korangar
The Broker wants to awaken **Korangar**, a buried god-monster. He believes controlling it will give him power over the galaxy.

Korangar has **four final forms**, each more chaotic than the last:
1. Wacky Warrior
2. Wiley Wizzard
3. Ridiculous Rogue
4. Super Mecha Death Korangar

---

### 🍾 Spike's Secret Power: The Paradox Flask
During the heist explosion, a shard of a Prime Ring embedded itself in Spike. The result? The **Paradox Flask** — a semi-conscious anomaly disguised as a liquor flask from the Loose Screw.

When Spike drinks from it in battle, there’s a chance reality glitches in his favor. He might summon ghost pirates, become intangible, or speak fluent monk-speak. It’s always dramatic. It’s never predictable. And Skitch always screams: “DON’T DRINK THAT, YOU DUMBASS, IT’S STILL WARMING UP!”

Spike now fights as a **tech gunslinger** with unpredictable gadgets and precision firepower, backed by quantum chaos.
