**The Rings of Chaos — Regions & World Map (Reboot Edition)**

---

### 🪐 Planet Overview: Cinderverge
Cinderverge is a lush, engineered paradise world divided into five massive, ring-shaped continents known as the **Land Rings**. Each ring has a unique environment, forgotten secrets, and some hidden connection to the **Prime Rings** — the five legendary relics that have now returned.

From above, the planet looks like a flower made of concentric land halos — or a vault built to never be opened. At its heart lies the true danger: **Korangar**.

### 🌍 The Five Rings of Cinderverge

#### 🔥 **Ashfold Ring** – “The Ruin of Flame”
- A volcanic wasteland with fire temples and lavaforged ruins
- Location of a dormant Prime Ring containment vault
- Monastic orders here lean toward militarism
- Constant earthquakes since the Broker’s return

#### 🌿 **Verdancy Ring** – “The Bloom That Watches”
- Dense jungle, overgrown machines, ancient bio-labs
- The plant life is semi-conscious and reactive to Prime energy
- Former research colonies now overrun with fauna and forgotten AI
- Home to some of the oldest Prime Forgian relics

#### ❄️ **Glassmire Ring** – “The Ice That Remembers”
- Frozen wastelands with fractal ice monasteries
- Light-based memory projection tech buried deep in the ice
- Monks here speak only in reflection (mirror puzzles and logic quests)
- Ring was silent for centuries — now signals have resumed

#### 🌊 **Coral Ring** – “The Floating Chorus”
- Shimmering water-ring composed of partially submerged cities and reefs
- Home of aquatic species and psionic resonance tech
- Music and tone used to communicate and shape local environment
- The sea levels are changing… fast

#### ⛰️ **Thorncradle Ring** – “The Broken Crown”
- Craggy, high-altitude ridges, wind temples, echo chambers
- Ring has literal gaps torn out of it from a past war
- Monasteries here are fractured and independent
- Skypaths can shift mid-crossing; gravity itself unreliable

---

### 🧭 World Design Principles
- Each ring has its own biome, history, and Prime Ring vault
- Rings are connected by orbital rail routes or jumpgates (some now malfunctioning)
- Quest and dungeon design embraces verticality, exploration, and discovery through lore objects
- The Loose Screw serves as the central fast-travel anchor between regions

### 🧩 Gameplay Hook: Ring Rebalancing
- As the Broker activates the Prime Rings, the world begins to fracture
- Gravity, light, sound, and even **player movement mechanics** change slightly per ring
- Players must “rebalance” each ring through gameplay to prevent Cinderverge from collapsing inward
