# 🏚 First Hub: Underground Village

Beneath the Corelink Annex lies a **hidden village** — the first true gameplay hub.

Populated by the **Dravenni**, this fungal-lit cavern serves as both tutorial zone and narrative anchor.

---

## 🧱 Structure & Purpose

- The Annex opens into a vertical shaft leading down into an ancient maintenance tunnel
- The tunnel is partially collapsed, but passable — and inhabited
- The village is made of **tech scrap**, **moss structures**, and **rewired Corelink infrastructure**

---

## 🎯 Gameplay Functions

- **System Tutorials**: Combat, crafting, movement, Corelink upgrades
- **Healing and Vendor Access**: Bozt provides health and combat resupply
- **Upgrade Stations**: Irra-Vant enables minor module upgrades
- **Lore & Class Flavor**: Lemzy and Clask offer weird, meaningful exposition

---

## 🧪 Early Quest: Reactivating the Grid

- Objective: Restore power to Corelink pads and basic village systems
- Mechanics: Circuit puzzles + mini-boss encounter
- Result: Unlocks vendors, lighting, recovery stations, early fast-travel

---

## 🧭 Hidden Access

After completing **five quests** in this zone, the player will trigger access to a **hidden dungeon**, deep beneath the outskirts of the village.
