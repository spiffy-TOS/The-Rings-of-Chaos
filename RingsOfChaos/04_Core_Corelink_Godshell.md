# üñ•Ô∏è The Core, Corelink & Godshell

- The Core: Planetary AI created by a precursor race (likely the Vothari). Enacts the TROC Protocol.
- The Godshell: Higher-order containment system. Rarely communicates, but does so through Corelinks, animals, or even trees.
- The Corelink: Class-based interface installed in all player characters. Modifiable. May react post-level 20 with random interventions.
