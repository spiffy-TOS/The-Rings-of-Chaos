## 🧠 Overview

The **Dravenni** are a minor, subterranean species who have evolved beneath the Corelink Annex — untouched by modern faction wars and almost entirely ignored by the godshell.

## 🧬 Visual Traits

- **Skin**: Claylike, kiln-fired in appearance, with glowing fungal veins
- **Eyes**: Glassy, glowing, sometimes flickering like static
- **Build**: Short (4–5 ft), hunched, occasionally asymmetrical
- **Movement**: Unpredictable — some hop, shuffle, or freeze mid-step
- **Clothing**: Patchwork robes, tech-rags, makeshift gear from drones and wire
- **Accessories**: Mandatory **headgear**, often built from scrap for no clear purpose
