# 🌍 World & Lore Overview

Cinderverge is a ring-based, partially collapsed world watched over by an ancient planetary AI called the Core, itself a subordinate interface to the godshell — a containment intelligence tasked with preventing the rise of a buried godkiller.

The Core can rewrite, relocate, or erase individuals to preserve balance. The player character, Trax, is a Corelink construct activated under emergency conditions by the TROC Protocol (Terminal Restraint of Chaos).
