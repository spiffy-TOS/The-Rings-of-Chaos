# 🎮 Gameplay Flow (Intro to Act I)

The opening of *The Rings of Chaos* establishes tone, world, and class — blending cinematic storytelling with early player choice.

---

## 🕹️ TITLE SEQUENCE TO INTRO

- **Title screen**: The Rings of Chaos burns into frame, over the rings of Cinderverge.
- **Start Game**: No customization screen. The player IS Trax.

---

## 🎬 CINEMATIC INTRO

- The camera moves through a calm night on Cinderverge.
- The camera cuts to a fortified island — the first seal site.
- Soldiers and NPCs go about their duties (Garrum, Vexra, Skitch appear).
- An explosion hits the southern gate — **pirates attack**.
- Chaos. Combat. Defenders are overwhelmed.

---

## 🔥 TROC ACTIVATION

- The Core senses the threat level breach.
- Trax is **digitized in**. Draven is **digitized out**.
- Trax lands like a comet, **eyes blazing**.
- First combat (cinematic). Trax devastates enemies.

---

## 🧠 PLAYER CONTROL: TUTORIAL

- Trax gains partial control — 8 class abilities shown, 2–3 realistically usable.
- Active battle system: No pauses, real-time combat pressure.
- A decision prompt appears mid-battle (save, ignore, divert help from Talya).

---

## 🌀 CLASS SELECTION IN TRANSIT

- The world dissolves.
- Trax floats in digital Corelink space.
- Five glowing class symbols appear in orbit:
  - A blade in flame → Ruinblade
  - A shadow split in three → Riftwalker
  - A storm in glass → Shardweaver
  - A horned beast → Hollowcaller
  - A skull in code → Grave Engineer

> *"Who you become... is chosen."*

## 🏛 THE CORELINK ANNEX

- The party rematerializes in the **Corelink Annex** — a pre-collapse lab.
- Tutorial dungeon: Reactivate power, unlock systems, learn mechanics.
- Exit elevator is repaired and activated.

---

## 🏴‍☠️ RETURN TO SURFACE

- The party emerges to find the **pirates now control the island**.
- The base is overrun. Soldiers captured. Skyships overhead.
