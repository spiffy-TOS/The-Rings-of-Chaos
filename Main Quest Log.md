### 🧭 Quest: SKYMARCH – Bloodfeud Begins

**Triggered by:** Defeating the Inflatable Cultist and returning to *The Loose Screw*

**Quest Giver:** Elaborately dressed Prime Forgian Monk

**Summary:**
After an eruption of chaos, a monk appears with revelations about the Prime Rings’ true danger. He explains the galaxy-spanning threat posed by someone gathering all five Rings. Spike and Skitch—though completely uninterested in the details—agree to help once Skitch declares a “skymarch” and Spike packs a kazoo and war jelly.

**Objectives:**

* Receive the monk’s explanation about the Prime Rings
* Learn that the Rings were launched into space because High Monk Jibjab said, “What if they’re, like… important later?”
* Accept the unhinged call to arms: “Join the bloodfeud!”
* Prepare to track down **Ring 4** before the Broker finds it

**Progression Unlocks:**

* Access to the next major region beyond the bottom ring of Cinderverge
* Begins the race to stop the Broker’s collection of all five Prime Rings

**Companion Notes:**

* Skitch insists he brought “blood-pickles” and that “the sky craves brine”
* Spike remains committed as long as there’s something to shoot and yell at

**Rewards:**

* New travel paths
* Story advancement
* Skitch and Spike’s shared **Chaos Attack** meter capacity increases by +10%
* Unlocks Chaos Gadget blueprint: *Ceremonial Kazoo (Decoy)*
