## ðŸ“ˆ Experience & Leveling

The Entropy Gun gains XP from use in battle. Each level up allows the gun to improve one of the following stats:

- ðŸŒ€ **Chaos Sync Rate** â€“ Faster meter fill or chaos chance
- âš¡ **Recharge Speed** â€“ Faster cooldown reduction
- ðŸŽ¯ **Crit Chance** â€“ Increases likelihood of special effects triggering harder

Stat upgrades are either:
- Randomized with weight
- Or selected by the player (TBD)

More attacks can be discovered across the world and added to the active pool once unlocked.
